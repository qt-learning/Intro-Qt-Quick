⭐ Skill Level: Beginner

⏱️ Time to Complete: 60 minutes

## Getting Started

- In this repo, you will find the guitar pedal project we are building throughout the course in different stages of completion.
- Each folder (apart from `00-Assets`) represents where you will end up after following each section of the course.
- The `00-Assets` folder contains all of the assets you will needed to follow along and create the final guitar pedal project.
- If you get stuck or encounter an issues, you can use these as references to get back up to speed and compare your progress.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and Qt Creator installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run a version of the project from a specific section, navigate to the desired section folder in Qt Creator and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.

Please note that in order to run the each section, you will need to copy the resources from the `00-Assets` folder into the section you wish to run. The assets are not included in the section folders to keep the repo size small.
